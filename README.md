# rock-paper-scissors
A rock paper scissors game programmed using Python. Made to help practice and develop skills using conditional statements and iteration loops

This program will ask user to enter rock paper scissors
User must enter 'rock','paper' or 'scissors'

Computer chooses 'rock','paper','scissors' as their choice as random

The code then checks for a win, lose, draw using the rule:
* rock beats scissors
* scissors beats paper
* paper beats rock

The result is printed and then will ask the user if they want to play again
If yes, another game starts
If no, the game ends and the stats are printed (No of games played, No of w/l/d)
